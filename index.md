This is Zendaya’s MET Gala look. It is a Cinderella dress designed by Law Roach that incorporates an LED solution for fabric colour changing in a daylight red carpet setting. This project is related to mine as I am also creating clothing with led lights. Instead of responding to light levels I am creating a jacket that responds to sound.  My aim is to create a more accessible version and incorporate sound.

This project is a device that allows users to translate sound to light! This plug-and-play stomp box analyses audio in real-time & generates music visualizations for smart LED pixels. This is similar to my project as I its LED’s that responds to sound. My aim is to incorporate something similar in a denim jacket.

This project is a fun way to display the status of all of your machines, to ensure the printers keep printing! This build uses a Particle Photon for its IoT capabilities, and Adafruit NeoPixels. This is similar to my project as it is wearable LED’s and that is another form of wearable tec.

This project is a Iconic Levi’s Trucker jacket merges style with innovative Jacquard technology. Answer calls, play music, and take photos right from your sleeve. This is similar to my project as it is a jacket with technology embedded in it.

https://mashable.com/2016/02/11/led-clothes/

This source is an article on the future of LED clothes. The article talks about different designers that are incorporating LED’s into their clothing, and briefly talks about the process of make the clothing and how to works. This gave me some ideas on how I could do my project. For example, the article says many designers use silhouettes popular in street like oversized and minimal this not only helps the aesthetic value of the project it will also help to hide the Micro Bit. The article also reviews the clothing and highlights some flaws in the design. This shows me what to avoid doing.

This article is similar to the previous one. This article goes more in-depth with the process of creating the clothing. This gave me inspiration on how I could do that.

the three video are tutorial on how to make sound and voice reactive LED’s using Arduino. Although this was made for thee Arduino, I could adapt it work with the micro bit.  These video helped me get an idea on how mine should work on the micro bit. The videos also helped me get an idea of the sound sensor and how to works.


https://invent.sparkfun.com/cwists/preview/2054x

This is a project someone has done that incorporates LED’s into a cape using a micro bit. What I have taken from this article is how to incorporate the LED’s. They used Lilly Pad LED’s with conductive thread. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxvBVvBWh4I

This video goes into detail on different sew able LED’s and wearable technology in general. What I took from this video was that Lilly Pad LED’s work really well for wearable LED’s. They are waterproof but can be a bit expensive.

This article is about Making LED Lights Sewable for Wearables and Conductive Thread This article. This article will help me make the LED’s I have sewable into the jacket.


https://osoyoo.com/2018/09/17/micro-bit-lesson-using-the-sound-detection-sensor/

This website showed me how to connect the Sound sensor to my micro bit and get it working it also showed a simple code I can use to test if it’s working.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
The Design intent for my project is to create a jacket with a design that has a design on the back pannel that incoperates LED's the resound to sould.

### Design concept 1 ###
My first design concept is a soundboard. It would allow to people to record sound and then play and loop them. The soundboard would have laptop connectivity allowing you to save the beat you have made. The soundboard would have a strip going down the centre and would come with a series to sticks with different coatings. Some have a thinner coating producing a different sound then one with a thick coting.


### Design concept 2 ###
My second design concept is a hat that moves to ward sound. There would be little spikes around the brim of the Hat that move toward where the sound in coming from. There would be a two sensors one on each side of the hat.

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
